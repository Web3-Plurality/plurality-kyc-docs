# Plurality 
Plurality is an identity-lego-building-block for dApp creators that lets them identify their users on blockchain without compromising their privacy.

Plurality supercharges DApps by helping them to:

1. Setup a verification mechanism tied to off-chain credentials in a few clicks
2. Use ZK-Proofs to prove on-chain that a user has been verified
3. Verify Personal Identifiable Information of user off-chain and never publish any sensitive information on chain - not even the blockchain address!

## Adding zero knowledge verification proofs on chain after verifying through Verifiable Credentials (VCs)

A demo to demonstrate how a user can use off-chain [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) to prove its identity to a DApp's verifier.

The DApp in this case is a mortgage lending platform that needs to check the identity of its users before allowing them access to lending resources. The DApp sets up a verifier and requests users to provide proof of valid german identity card. After verification, the verifier pushes zero knowledge proof of identification on chain so that the DApp can allow/disallow the user from accessing its services on-chain.

### Video

The short intro and demo video of this project can be found here: https://youtu.be/7fA5Kyl2NcA

To run this demo, you need:

- an SSI wallet ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esatus.wallet&hl=de&pli=1), [apple](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/esatus-wallet/id1496769057))
- the wallet needs to be on the Bcovrin Test Ledger (you can change the ledger from settings by uploading the [genesis file](http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io/genesis) )

This demo has three different perspectives: Issuer's, Verifier's and Dapp's

### The Issuer:

- Uses standard opensource SSI framework components like [Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python] (https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) and [Business Partner Agent] (https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/business-partner-agent)
- Issues SSI based credentials to the user wallet after establishing a connection using on DID communication protocol
- Can revoke this user's access at a later point in time
- In our demo use case the issuer issues an identity card to the user's Identity wallet 
- The issuer demo service can be accessed at this public address[issuer](http://bpa.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/)

### The Verifier:

- Asks the user to connect using QR code scanning by mobile wallet
- Asks the user to present off-chain proof using the credentials in his/her mobile wallet
- Verifies the credentials to check if proof requirements are satisfied
- Create a new identity for this user correlated with this user's Decentralized Identifier (DID)
- Adds this user's identity to the SemaphoreIdentity contract to the appropriate group
- Can revoke this user's access at a later point in time
- The verifier demo service can be accessed at this public address [verifier](http://bpa.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com:3001/)

### The DApp:

- Asks the user to submit zero knowledge proof that he/she is already verified on the SemaphoreIdentity contract
- Approves the (mortgage/loan) request if the user's zero knowledge proof is correct.
